# Job Tracker
It is a job tracker chrome extension that allows you to save job post from multiple jobs platform and manage job progress that you have applied.

## Description:
If you are a fresh graduate or people who are looking for another career, then you must have used various job platforms to search for your desired jobs and saved it down for applying that jobs later. However, when you saved and applied a lot of jobs across multiple platform. It will be difficult to manage all of the saved jobs and easy to lose track of the progress for the job that you applied. Therefore, this Job Tracker is here to help you to manage all of the saved jobs and applied jobs across multiple platform. Currently, this job tracker will now only support Jobsdb and Linkedin.

When you clicked job saved button on those website, it will automatically register the job post necessary information into Job Tracker, including

- Company Name
- Job title
- Job duties
- Benefit and Compensation (if provided)
- How to apply

Then there will be 5 tab that allow you monitor the job application progress, including

- Saved
- Applied
- Interview in Progress
- Return Offer
- Archive

When you clicked "apply" in the Saved tab, the job that you applied will automatically change their status to Applied. In the Applied tab, you can manually based on the job progress to change the status to Interview in Progress or Return Offer or Archive. 

However, sometimes, you are not lucky in your job hunting progress that you receive no reply after applying the job or after the interview. If the job status is inactive for 30 days, that the job status will automatically turn into Archive. Also, you can manually change the job status to Archive if you want.

I hope this extension will help your job hunting journey. Happy Job Hunting!!
